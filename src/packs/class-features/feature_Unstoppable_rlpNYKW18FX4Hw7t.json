Place it on this sheet in the space provided, starting with the 1 value facing up. After you make a damage roll that deals 1 or more Hit Points to a target, increase the Unstoppable Die value by one. When the die’s value would exceed its maximum value or when the scene ends, remove the die and drop out of Unstoppable. At level 5, your Unstoppable Die increases to a d6.</p><p>While Unstoppable, you gain the following benefits:</p><p>• You reduce the severity of physical damage by one threshold (Severe to Major, Major to Minor, Minor to None).</p><p>• You add the current value of the Unstoppable Die to your damage roll.</p><p>• You can’t be Restrained or Vulnerable.</p>",

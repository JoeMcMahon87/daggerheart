This move means that if a PC hits one minion and they do enough damage, they also hit a number of others that are in range for them. Because of this, it’s often best to have minions crowd a PC–it will feel overwhelming and dangerous until they’re able to make an attack against them. If you want that cinematic feeling of the PCs taking out waves of enemies with a single attack roll, minions are a great tool to make that happen."

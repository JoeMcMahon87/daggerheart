# Developer Guide
#### Setup
- Open a terminal in the directory with the repo `cd <path>/<to>/<repo>`
- Install npm `npm install`
- Update package.json to match your profile
```
"start": "concurrently \"rollup -c --watch\" \"node C:/FoundryDev/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=C:/FoundryDevFiles  --noupnp\"  \"gulp\"",
"start-test": "node C:/FoundryDev/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=C:/FoundryDevFiles && rollup -c --watch && gulp",

```
- Replace `C:/FoundryDev/resources/app/main.js` with `<your>/<path>/<to>/<foundry>/<main.js>`
- The main is likely in `<Foundry Install Location>/resouces/app/main.js`
- Replace `--dataPath=C:/FoundryDevFiles` with `<your>/<path>/<to>/<foundry>/<data>`

Now you should be able to build the app using `npm start`
